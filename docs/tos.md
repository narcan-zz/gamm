---
By installing and using this add-on (henceforth referred to as "the app"), you (henceforth referred to as "the user") accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. In addition, when using the services of the app, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS.

INSTALLATION AND USE OF THIS APP WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE ABOVE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS APP.

##Liability Disclaimer
This app and its components are offered for use with Google Analytics properties to which the user has authorization to access. Neither the app nor the developer shall be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness or availability of any information transmitted or made available via the app, and neither the app nor the developer shall be held responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that information.

##Intellectual Property Rights
If you believe your intellecutal property rights have been infringed upon, please contact the developer directly at *dev@gamanagementmagic.com*.

##Advertisements
This app is not running any advertisements, and any perceived endorsement of any product or service other than itself is coincedence. If that were to ever change, rest assured that **this** TOS would be updated and the developer would only endorse products that they have personally tried and/or researched.

##Data and Privacy
This app processes data shared in the Google Spreadsheet via the Google API, for the sole purposes of reading/writing to the Google Analytics accounts/properties/views indicated by the user. Additionally, this app does not store any data that you share with it (storage is only done in the local Google Spreadsheet controlled by the user, and the developer does not have access to these sheets unless explicitly granted by the user).

##Analytics
This app uses Google Analytics to collect aggregated usage data in order to better understand how the product is used (for product improvements and for product support). It does not collect **ANY** personally identifying information (PII) about the user or the properties it handles, nor does it share any collected data with anyone else. Seriously.
